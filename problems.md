# About

I created this repo because I wanted a central location that housed a list of problems that need to be solved with JavaScript. These problems can be related to any JavaScript framework or library or they can be completely disassociated problems that can be solved by using JavaScript.

The problems below are divided up into different sections (React, Angular, Node, etc.). If a section does not exist for your particular problem feel free to create that section when submitting your problem. 

If you notice that a section is growing quite fast and needs to be divided up further into sub-sections, please submit a pull request!

Any pull request that meets these guidelines will be accepted! Thanks for helping me build this list!
